          Throughout IST 110, I gained a stronger understanding of how information systems work and why they are so important in everyday life. The assignments and discussions helped me explore topics like databases, operating systems, the Internet, programming languages, and computer hardware. Working on SQL, Excel macros, device teardowns, and OS comparisons showed me how technology functions behind the scenes and how even small design choices can affect performance, security, and usability.

          The course also helped me reflect on how technology shapes people’s routines, decisions, and interactions. Whether it was studying privacy concerns, researching how companies use IT, or analyzing personal tools like YouTube Music, I learned how deeply technology is integrated into modern life. Overall, IST 110 strengthened both my technical foundation and my awareness of technology’s impact on society, preparing me to engage with digital systems more thoughtfully and responsibly.
